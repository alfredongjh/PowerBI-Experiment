**X Telecom** is a major Australian mobile network company with business across different countries (i.e., Australia, UK, 
China, USA, Germany). It offers four major plans with a monthly cost between $20-$50 AUD, different 
data rates, and offers to complement plans with an option for international calls.


## Problem statement
**X Telecom** is financially struggling as their customer churn has increased over the past. The churn rate, 
also known as the rate of attrition or customer churn, is the rate at which customers stop doing business 
with an entity. Telecom measures customer churn by looking at whether or not a customer discontinues 
the service with them. If customers churn, it means that they stop doing business with Telecom and 
move to another provider. The churn rate and growth rate are diametrically opposite factors, as the 
former measures the loss of customers and the other measures the acquisition of customers.
Attempt to understand drivers of their customer churn and inform their decision making.
